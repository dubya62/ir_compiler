[] = tool required to perform step
() = people who worked on that tool this sprint

COMPILER:
    Objective: accept a C source file and optimize it using community generated code

    [C -> ir compiler](Holden and Sam) - compile C source file to our custom IR
    [rule based engine](Holden), [rule database] - apply symbol subsitution rules from a database to the IR
    [ir -> C compiler](Trisha) - compile optimized IR back to platform independent C


WEBSITE: (Calvin, Trisha, and Sam)
    Objective: collect verifiable solutions to programming problems to increase database knowledge

    [Website] - User writes and submits a solution to a given problem in C
    [C -> ir compiler]- compile to custom IR
    [ir -> rule](future sprint) - convert IR to a rule and add to the rule database
